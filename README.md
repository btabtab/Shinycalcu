# Shinycalcu
This software is going to be used to calculate the chances of encountering a shiny Pokemon after a certain amount of encounters

the goal of this is to also include the encounter rate of pokemon appearing such as pikachu having a 5% encounter rate in viridian forest and there being only a 1/8192 chance of encountering a shiny pokemon.
